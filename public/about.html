            <td> <p>The success of The Party Planner is a result of the team working tirelessly to ensure that every component of the event unravels exactly as planned.
             A factor that unites each member of the team is a ‘passion for experience’ - a steadfast commitment to ensuring that every event is an experience, 
             a memory that will stay in the mind of those present long after they have left the venue. 
             The Party Planner was founded in 2009; with a combined experience of 100+ years in the field, 
             the founding team noticed that there was a clear gap in the industry for a professional and reliable innovation-driven event management company. </br>At The Party Planner,
             our focus is a simple one – event management in a way that creates a win-win situation for all involved stakeholders. 
             Our goal is to ensure that our clients as well as participants of the event have an overall positive experience. To do this, our team is professional and polite – 
             we don’t look at building one-time associations with clients, instead, aim at creating long-lasting collaborations that will span years to come. </p>
